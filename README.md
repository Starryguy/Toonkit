Toonkit
=======
Toonkit is a Toontown private server kit based of Toontown Infinite. Our aim is to provide an easily customisable system.

In order to run this software, you require [Panda3D](https://github.com/Astron/panda3d) and [Astron](https://Astron/Astron). We are currently **not** providing pre-built versions of these. You will also require the [in-game resources](https://github.com/Starryguy/Toonkit-res).
